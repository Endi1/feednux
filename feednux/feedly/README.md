# Feedly API python wrapper

## Why?

    I needed a wrapper to use when developing feednux, since the only
    one for Python I could find was outdated, I decided to develop my
    own one.
    
## Get it
    
    There are two ways to get the library, either through pip or
    directly from github.
    
    `pip install pyfeedly` or `git clone https://github.com/endi1/pyfeedly`
